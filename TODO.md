TODO List

- `return 5` is parsed differently from `return(5)` and could be really confusing to many people. I should add error reporting for this case.
- flexible pattern matching is really important in the language. perhaps even go beyond what erlang / scala provide and provide a full blow parser combinator DSL.
- multiline operators would be really awesome especially when lining things up for the pipe operator.
