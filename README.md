To build: `mvn package -DskipTests`.

The output binaries will appear in `target/lib/silo-<version>/`. To run Silo simply execute `target/lib/silo-<version>/bin/silo`. As a convenience the `target/lib/silo-<version>` directory is bundled together as zip and tgz archives so Silo can be easily copied onto another machine.
